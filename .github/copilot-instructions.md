## General Guidelines
- Prefer accessibility and SEO best practices: add ARIA roles and labels, skip links, visible focus styles, meta description, and accessible form controls.
- Ensure the hamburger menu is visible only on small devices (hide on laptops/desktops) while keeping the primary navigation visible on larger screens; show mobile navigation when the hamburger menu is toggled.
